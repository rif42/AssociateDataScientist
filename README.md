# AssociateDataScientist

## Project Description  
This project is a final product of my special 6th semester program Bengkel Koding at Dian Nuswantoro University. Project is made in written coding tutorial form so students can read, follow along, and modify the codes as they see fit.  
This project aims to help students (mostly less tech-savvy students) learn important data science concepts asynchronously to help them in the Associate Data Scientist certification exam at the end of the semester.  
This project uses government made (KOMINFO) academic materials as the main guide. However, because the material is slightly outdated, unwieldy, and lack detail, this project aims to improve upon the material by expanding the material coverage, using research paper to enhance material quality, while providing real runnable codes and visualization.  

## Tech Stack  
### Python  
The most popular in the programming field and the most approachable language for newbies. Python also has huge range of libraries to help our data cleaning process.  

### VSCode  
A super versatile yet lightweight code editor suited for all low to medium coding workloads. VSCode is the best for newbie programmers trying to familliarize themselves with codes. 
Alternatively, newbies could use jupyter lab.

### Quarto
A program that provides an amazing format to consume coding tutorials. Its basically a notebook file (.ipynb) but when rendered, it runs all the cells, runs all the codes, also renders the output too.  
As a result, you get coding instruction (written in markdown), the code itself (python), and the output (and graphs) of the code in just one page. This makes consuming coding tutorials much easier  

### Streanlit
A free service that makes deploying machine learning models easier. The functions are simple enough you dont have to edit too much of the code to make it work.  

## Running the Project  

### Running Project Locally (Quarto)
This project uses Quarto to present all the content, so we need to set up our machine to support Quarto

- Download Quarto at https://quarto.org/docs/download/
- Install Quarto extension in VSCode
- Install Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode
- Clone the repository
- cd into the repository and run `pip install`
- after install finished, run `quarto preview`
